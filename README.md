# How to use the "frames" folder

When rendering, blender will store each frames in a temp folder, this folder is here to act as that temp folder (you don't have to use it, but it would be nicer)

# How to use the "Rendered animations and still previews" folder

After rendering each frames, feel free to put the final animation in this folder, rename your blend file to something you think would fit (and won't conflict with the other files already in this git), and send a pull request.

If you just want to show a still preview of your blend file, just make sure to put (still preview) in the name of the preview image

# Have fun creating your .blend and don't hesitate to share them!
